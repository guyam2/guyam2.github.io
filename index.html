I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, advised by is <a href="https://www.katz-lab.com/">Dr. Guy Katz</a>.
My research focuses on applying formal methods for verifying machine-learning models, with an emphasis on Deep Neural Networks, deployed on safety-critical systems.
I studied my BS.c. in Computational Biology & Computer Science (2017-2020), and my MS.c. in Computer Science (2019-2020) both at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
