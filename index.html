<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at 
<a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>.</p>


<p>Previously, I completed my Ph.D. (2021–2024) at the 
<a href="https://en.huji.ac.il/en/">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a> under the 
supervision of <a href="https://www.katz-lab.com/">Professor Guy Katz</a>, where I 
worked on formally verifying the correctness of AI-controlled robots.</p>

<p>I hold a B.Sc. in Computational Biology & Computer Science (2017–2020) and an 
M.Sc. in Computer Science (2020–2021), both from the Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>I am a <a href="https://www.yadhanadiv.org.il/rothschild-fellows">Rothschild Fellow</a> and have also been fortunate to receive a
