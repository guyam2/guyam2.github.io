I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by <a href="https://www.katz-lab.com/">Dr. Guy Katz</a> from the 
<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, 
the <a href="https://en.huji.ac.il/en/">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>.

<br>My research focuses on applying formal methods for verifying machine-learning models deployed on safety-critical systems.
<br>I studied my BS.c. in Computational Biology & Computer Science (2017-2020), and my MS.c. in Computer Science (2019-2020) both 
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
